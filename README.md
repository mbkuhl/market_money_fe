# Market Money

This repository is one of a pair of repositories for the Market Money project. You can find the back end repository [here](https://github.com/mbkuhl/market_money).

### About this Project

"You are working for a company developing an interface to help people find sustainable and local alternatives for their lifestyle in their area. One of their features to encourage supporting local growers/crafters/etc., is a Farmers Market lookup. Your company uses a Micro Service Architecture, and needs you to build out the service that is responsible for providing functionality for Farmers Market & Vendors."

My job is to expose the data that powers this part of the site through an API that the front end would consume. I would then build the front end that consumes this API.
